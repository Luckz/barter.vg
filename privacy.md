All information that you post to Barter.vg will be visible to anyone viewing the site, unless the input form explicitly notes otherwise. This includes information that is automatically collected from public Steam profiles and other public profiles.

You can edit and remove your game collections, but not offers that have been accepted or declined. You can initiate corrections to offers by mutual consent (sender and receiver agree to changes), or through a mediator during the dispute process.

**Personal information collected**  
The site collects public Steam profiles and user-provided data on game collections in order to share them on the site and through APIs. When logged in, you can access this information at https://barter.vg/u/my/data/
The default assumption is that, other than login credentials, users are providing information intended for others to view and process. Therefore, do not post anything that you or others wish to remain private.

**Technical information collected**  
Logging services track identifying attributes, such as IP address, Barter.vg user id, browser and operating system, in order to monitor site usage, diagnose problems, and investigate abuse.

**Cookies**  
This site uses cookies to monitor site usage and to manage authentication. If you block cookies from the barter.vg domain, you will not be able to login. The login cookie is accessible only over TLS and therefore you must be able to access the https version of this site to login.
